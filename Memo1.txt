xEdit is an advanced graphical esp editor and conflict detector.

The navigation treeview on the left side shows all active masters and plugins in their correct load order. By navigating that treeview you can look at every single record in any of your masters or plugins. Once a record has been selected the detailed contents of that record is shown on the right side.

The view treeview shows all versions of the selected record from all plugins which contain it. The left most column is the master. The right most column is the plugin that "wins". This is the version of the record that the game sees.

The navigation and view treeview use the same color coding to signal the conflict state of individual fields (in the view treeview) and the record overall (in the navigation treeview).

Previously colors were listed by background and text color. Instead, click the Legend button in the upper right corner. The Legend window will summarizes the meaning of the colors.

Conflict detection is not simply based on the existence of multiple records for the same FormID in different plugins but instead performs a comparison of the parsed subrecord data.

The navigation treeview has a context menu where you can activate filtering. Filtering is based on the same conflict categorization as the background and text color.

Modgroups:

For a modgroup the be activateable, the order of the mods in the load order and modgroup must match.

If a modgroup is active, what it essentially means is that for each record that is contained in more than one mod of the modgroup, only the last (in load order) is visible. That's it. The invisible record versions simply don't participate in the normal conflict detection mechanisms at all.

A modgroup does not perform any merge or make any changes to any mod. All it does it hide away version of records that you've stated (by defining the modgroup) that you've already checked them against each other and the hidden record is simply irrelevant.

Modgroups File and Syntax:

[xEdit EXE Name].modgroups i.e. SSEEdit.modgroups for SSEEdit. Save in the same folder as the EXE.
[Plugin Name].modgroups i.e. for Someplugin.esp, Someplugin.modgroups. Save the file in your Data folder instead.

Prefixes are processed from left to right. #@Plugin.esp is the same -Plugin.esp. They combine "negatively" not positively.

without prefix file is both a target and a source
+ The file is optional
- The file is neither a target nor a source.
} Ignore load order completely
{ Ignore load order among a consecutive block of mods marked with this.
@ File is not a source
# File is not a target
! File is forbidden. If the listed module is active, the modgroup is invalid.
<filename>:CRC32

If a module is followed by a list of one or more CRC values, the modgroup is only available if the module has one of the listed CRCs. Source means that if a record in this mod is found, then it will hide the versions of the same record from all mods listed above it that are targets.

[Modgroup Name]
MainPlugin.esm
MainPlugin - A.esp
MainPlugin - B.esp
MainPlugin - C.esp
MainPlugin - D.esp
MainPlugin - E.esp

The above example means that all in that particular order for the modgroup to be activateable.

[Modgroup Name A]
-MainPlugin - C.esp
MainPlugin - D.esp
MainPlugin - E.esp

[Modgroup Name B]
MainPlugin - C.esp
-MainPlugin - D.esp
MainPlugin - E.esp

Group A) If a record is present in E and D, the records from plugin D will be hidden.
Group B) If a record is present in E and C, the records from plugin C will be hidden.

[Modgroup Name]
MainPlugin - C.esp:12345678
MainPlugin - D.esp:A1B2C3D4,F9E8D7C6
MainPlugin - E.esp


Not all mod groups defined in that file will necessarily show up in the selection list. Mod groups for which less then 2 plugins are currently active are filtered. If the load order of plugins doesn't match the order in the mod group it is also filtered.

What's the effect of having a mod group active?

When a record for the view treeview is generated and multiple files of the same mod group modify this record, then only the newest of the files in that modgroup will be shown. So instead of seeing 5 different files with numerous conflicts you are only seeing the newest file in that mod group. This also affects conflict classification.

It's worth pointing out here that if a record is overridden by both plugins in a mod group and other plugins that normal conflict detection will still work perfectly.

Basically this system can be used to reduce a lot of noise from the conflict reports.

Reference Caching:

[GameMode]\Data\FO4Edit Cache

Cache files are based on the CRC of the xEdit EXE, then the plugin filename. For example 3917E178_DLCNukaWorld_esm_43D25C56.refcache. Once built xEdit will load the cache file rather then build the references again. This reduces load time.

xEdit Backup Files:

[GameMode]\Data\FO4Edit Backups

Backups are saved with the file name [PluginName].[esm/esp/els].backup.[Date Stamp} For example PluginName.esp.backup.2018_07_25_20_52_10. These can be renamed and copied to the Data folder.

Show Only Master and Leafs:

What this does is, similar to modgroups, reduce which records are being show in the view treeview (and are taken into account for calculating conflict information).

Suppose you have the following mods:


+------------+
|            |
|   Master   |
|            |
+----^-------+
       |
       |       +--------------+                +-------------+
       |       |              <----------------+             |
       +-------+      A       |                |      D      |
       |       |              <-----+          |             |
       |       +--------------+     |          +-------------+
       |                            |
       |       +--------------+     |          +-------------+
       |       |              |     +----------+             |
       +-------+      B       |                |      E      |
       |       |              <----------------+             |
       |       +--------------+                +-------------+
       |
       |       +--------------+
       |       |              |
       +-------+      C       |
               |              |
               +--------------+

Then with active "Only Master and Leafs" only Master, D, E, and C will be shown. The assumption here being that whatever the contents of A or B, it's already being taken into account by D and/or E.

This assumption is obviously only true if the author of mods D and E did their job correctly, so this isn't a good option to have always enabled. As long as that assumption holds true, it can declutter the reported conflicts significantly.
