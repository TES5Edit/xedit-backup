All xEdit versions for different games (TES5Edit, FO4Edit, FNVEdit, etc.) are the same executable, you can rename to run in a different game mode
You can run in several game modes from the same xEdit executable by creating different shortcuts with command line parameters like -fo4 -edit
xLODGen LOD generator tools are the same executables as xEdit, you can generate LOD for a worldspace by right clicking on a plugin with world -> Other -> Generate LOD
You can switch between different language strings files in [Hamburger Menu] -> Localization -> Language menu (Skyrim and later games)
Add -l:fr command line parameter to use strings files for the specified language by default, where "fr" is the language ID of strings files (Skyrim and later games)
Adding -cp:utf-8 command line parameters adds support for the game languages that use UTF-8 encoding (Skyrim and later games)

xEdit stores all of it's settings in Plugins.XXXviewsettings file located in the same folder as plugins.txt, but if you create ini file with the same name as executable in the same folder (FO4Edit.ini for example), xEdit will use it instead
You can reset ALL settings by holding Ctrl + Shift + Alt while starting
If you don't see xEdit window after launching, hold Shift next time to reset window position
Italic font in the left pane means that those records or other record(s) deeper in the tree are injected. They have FormID load order index of a master file but don't override any records from it
Underlined font in the left pane means that the reference(s) of those records are injected
Red background color in the records tree doesn't mean something bad, it is just an indication that record(s) are overridden by later loaded plugins having different data
xEdit can't load more than 256 modules (games without ESL support) or 253 full modules and 4096 light modules (SSE, FO4) at once due to FormID numbers limitation
You can't reorder plugins in xEdit. Games prior to Skyrim (TES4, FO3, FNV) use plugin files dates for ordering, Skyrim and later games use order defined in the plugins.txt file

All exterior persistent references are located in a single persistent cell of a worldspace, however if you double click on FormID field of a reference in the right pane, the real world grid (X,Y) coordinates are shown at the end of description
Records override each other using "Rule of one", which means the winning record from the last loaded plugin fully discards all data from the previous ones (except for a few rare occasions)
